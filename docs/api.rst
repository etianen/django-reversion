.. _api:

django-reversion API
====================

Use the django-reversion API to build version-controlled apps. See also :ref:`Views` and :ref:`Middleware`.


Overview
--------

Registering models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Models must be registered with django-reversion before they can be used with the API.

.. code:: python

    from django.db import models
    import reversion

    @reversion.register()
    class YourModel(models.Model):

        pass

.. Hint::
    If you're using the :ref:`admin`, model registration is automatic. If youâ€™re using django-reversion in a management command, make sure you call ``django.contrib.admin.autodiscover()`` to load the admin modules before using the django-reversion API.

.. include:: /_include/post-register.rst


Creating revisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *revision* represents one or more changes made to your model instances, grouped together as a single unit. You create a revision by creating a *revision block*. When you call ``save()`` on a registered model inside a revision block, it will be added to that revision.

.. code:: python

    # Declare a revision block.
    with reversion.create_revision():

        # Save a new model instance.
        obj = YourModel()
        obj.name = "obj v1"
        obj.save()

        # Store some meta-information.
        reversion.set_user(request.user)
        reversion.set_comment("Created revision 1")

    # Declare a new revision block.
    with reversion.create_revision():

        # Update the model instance.
        obj.name = "obj v2"
        obj.save()

        # Store some meta-information.
        reversion.set_user(request.user)
        reversion.set_comment("Created revision 2")

.. Important::

    Bulk actions, such as ``Queryset.update()``, do not send signals, so won't be noticed by django-reversion.


Loading revisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each model instance saved in a revision block is serialized as a :ref:`Version`. All versions in a revision block are associated with a single :ref:`Revision`.

You can load a :ref:`VersionQuerySet` of versions from the database. Versions are loaded with the most recent version first.

.. code:: python

    from reversion.models import Version

    # Load a queryset of versions for a specific model instance.
    versions = Version.objects.get_for_object(instance)
    assert len(versions) == 2

    # Check the serialized data for the first version.
    assert versions[1].field_dict["name"] == "obj v1"

    # Check the serialized data for the second version.
    assert versions[0].field_dict["name"] == "obj v2"


Revision metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Revision` stores meta-information about the revision.

.. code:: python

    # Check the revision metadata for the first revision.
    assert versions[1].revision.comment == "Created revision 1"
    assert versions[1].revision.user == request.user
    assert isinstance(versions[1].revision.date_created, datetime.datetime)

    # Check the revision metadata for the second revision.
    assert versions[0].revision.comment == "Created revision 2"
    assert versions[0].revision.user == request.user
    assert isinstance(versions[0].revision.date_created, datetime.datetime)


Reverting revisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Revert a :ref:`Revision` to restore the serialized model instances.

.. code:: python

    # Revert the first revision.
    versions[1].revision.revert()

    # Check the model instance has been reverted.
    obj.refresh_from_db()
    assert obj.name == "version 1"

    # Revert the second revision.
    versions[0].revision.revert()

    # Check the model instance has been reverted.
    obj.refresh_from_db()
    assert obj.name == "version 2"


Restoring deleted model instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reverting a :ref:`Revision` will restore any serialized model instances that have been deleted.

.. code:: python

    # Delete the model instance, but store the pk.
    pk = obj.pk
    obj.delete()

    # Revert the second revision.
    versions[0].revision.revert()

    # Check the model has been restored to the database.
    obj = YourModel.objects.get(pk=obj.pk)
    assert obj.name == "version 2"


.. _registration-api:

Registration API
----------------

.. _register:

``reversion.register(model, **options)``

    Registers a model with django-reversion.

    Throws :ref:`RegistrationError` if the model has already been registered.

    ``model``
        The Django model to register.

    ``fields=None``
        An iterable of field names to include in the serialized data. If ``None``, all fields will be included.

    ``exclude=()``
        An iterable of field names to exclude from the serialized data.

    ``follow=()``
        An iterable of model relationships to follow when saving a version of this model. ``ForeignKey``, ``ManyToManyField`` and reversion ``ForeignKey`` relationships are supported. Any property that returns a ``Model`` or ``QuerySet`` is also supported.

    ``format="json"``
        The name of a Django serialization format to use when saving the model instance.

    ``for_concrete_model=True``
        If ``True`` proxy models will be saved under the same content type as their concrete model. If ``False``, proxy models will be saved under their own content type, effectively giving proxy models their own distinct history.

    ``ignore_duplicates=False``
        If ``True``, then an additional check is performed to avoid saving duplicate versions for this model.

        Checking for duplicate revisions adds significant overhead to the process of creating a revision. Don't enable it unless you really need it!

    ``use_natural_foreign_keys=False``
        If ``True``, the the model will be serialized using natural keys.

        See `Serialization of natural keys <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/serialization/#serialization-of-natural-keys>`_

    .. Hint::
        By default, django-reversion will not register any parent classes of a model that uses multi-table inheritance. If you wish to also add parent models to your revision, you must explicitly add their ``parent_ptr`` fields to the ``follow`` parameter when you register the model.

    .. include:: /_include/post-register.rst


``reversion.is_registered(model)``

    Returns whether the given model has been registered with django-reversion.

    ``model``
        The Django model to check.


``reversion.unregister(model)``

    Unregisters the given model from django-reversion.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-registration-error.rst

    ``model``
        The Django model to unregister.


``reversion.get_registered_models()``

    Returns an iterable of all registered models.


.. _revision-api:

Revision API
------------

``reversion.create_revision(manage_manually=False, using=None, atomic=True)``

    Marks a block of code as a *revision block*. Can also be used as a decorator.

    .. include:: /_include/create-revision-args.rst


``reversion.is_active()``

    Returns whether there is currently an active revision block.


``reversion.is_manage_manually()``

    Returns whether the current revision block is in ``manage_manually`` mode.


``reversion.set_user(user)``

    Sets the user for the current revision.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-revision-error.rst

    ``user``
        A ``User`` model instance (or whatever your ``settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`` is).


``reversion.get_user()``

    Returns the user for the current revision.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-revision-error.rst


.. _set_comment:

``reversion.set_comment(comment)``

    Sets the comment for the current revision.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-revision-error.rst

    ``comment``
        The text comment for the revision.


``reversion.get_comment()``

    Returns the comment for the current revision.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-revision-error.rst


``reversion.set_date_created(date_created)``

    Sets the creation date for the current revision.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-revision-error.rst

    ``date_created``
        The creation date for the revision.


``reversion.get_date_created()``

    Returns the creation date for the current revision.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-revision-error.rst


``reversion.add_meta(model_or_instance, **values)``

    Adds custom metadata to a revision.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-revision-error.rst

    ``model or instance``
        A Django model or model instance to store the custom metadata. The model must have a ``ForeignKey`` or ``OneToOneField`` to :ref:`Revision`. This field can optionally be nullable.

    ``**values``
        Values to be stored on ``model`` when it is saved.

    Example:

    .. code:: python

       // model

       class RevisionMeta(models.Model):

           revision = models.OneToOneField(
               Revision,
               on_delete=models.CASCADE
           )

           version_label = models.CharField(max_length=200)


       // Creating reversion with meta data

       with reversion.create_revision():

           # Save a new model instance.
           obj = YourModel()
           obj.name = "obj v1"
           obj.save()

           reversion.add_meta(RevisionMeta, version_label='Object Version #1')


    If you need to create meta data before you create a revision, you can make the ``revision`` field nullable

    .. code:: python

       class RevisionMeta(models.Model):

           revision = models.OneToOneField(
               Revision,
               on_delete=models.CASCADE,
               null=True
           )

           version_label = models.CharField(max_length=200)


    Then you can supply the ``instance`` to ``add_meta``

    .. code:: python

       RevisionMeta.objects.create(version_label='Object Version #1')

       // ...

       with reversion.create_revision():

           # Save a new model instance.
           obj = YourModel()
           obj.name = "obj v1"
           obj.save()

           reversion.add_meta(
               RevisionMeta.objects.get(...)
           )

    When an instance is supplied, an update is performed, which will attach the current revision to it. This
    also will update any extra fields supplied.

    Adds a model instance to a revision.

    .. include:: /_include/throws-revision-error.rst
