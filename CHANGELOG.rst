2.0.0 - 11/06/2016
------------------

django-reversion was first released in May 2008, and has been in active development ever since. Over this time it's developed a certain amount of cruft from legacy and unused features, resulting in needless complexity and multiple ways of achieving the same task.

This release substantially cleans and refactors the codebase. Much of the top-level functionality remains unchanged or is very similar. The release notes are divided into subsections to make it easier to find out where you need to update your code.

This release includes a migration for the ``Version`` model that may take some time to complete.


General improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Dramatically improved performance of version lookup for models with a non-integer primary key (@etianen, @mshannon1123).
* Documentation refactor (@etianen).
* Test refactor (@etianen).
* Minor tweaks and bugfixes (@etianen, @bmarika, @ticosax).


Admin
^^^^^

* Fixed issue with empty revisions being created in combination with ``RevisionMiddleware`` (@etianen).

* **Breaking:** Removed ``reversion_format`` property from ``VersionAdmin`` (@etianen).

    Use ``VersionAdmin.reversion_register`` instead.

    .. code::

        class YourVersionAdmin(VersionAdmin):

            def reversion_register(self, model, **options):
                options["format"] = "yaml"
                super(YourVersionAdmin, self).reversion_register(model, **options)

* **Breaking:** Removed ``ignore_duplicate_revisions`` property from ``VersionAdmin`` (@etianen).

    Use ``VersionAdmin.reversion_register`` instead.

    .. code::

        class YourVersionAdmin(VersionAdmin):

            def reversion_register(self, model, **options):
                options["ignore_duplicate_revisions"] = True
                super(YourVersionAdmin, self).reversion_register(model, **options)




Management commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Breaking:** Refactored arguments to ``createinitialrevisions`` (@etianen).

    All existing functionality should still be supported, but several parameter names have been updated to match Django coding conventions.

    Check the command ``--help`` for details.

* **Breaking:** Refactored arguments to ``deleterevisions`` (@etianen).

    All existing functionality should still be supported, but several parameter names have been updated to match Django coding conventions, and some duplicate parameters have been removed. The confirmation prompt has been removed entirely, and the command now always runs in the ``--force`` mode from the previous version.

    Check the command ``--help`` for details.


Middleware
^^^^^^^^^^

* Added support for using ``RevisionMiddleware`` with new-style Django 1.10 ``MIDDLEWARE`` (@etianen).
* Middleware wraps entire request in ``transaction.atomic()`` to preserve transactional integrity of revision and models (@etianen).


View helpers
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added ``reversion.views.create_revision`` view decorator (@etianen).
* Added ``reversion.views.RevisionMixin`` class-based view mixin (@etianen).


Low-level API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Restored many of the django-reversion API methods back to the top-level namespace (@etianen).
* Revision blocks are now automatically wrapped in ``transaction.atomic()`` (@etianen).
* Added ``for_concrete_model`` argument to ``reversion.register()`` (@etianen).
* Added ``Version.objects.get_for_model()`` lookup function (@etianen).
* Added ``reversion.add_to_revision()`` for manually adding model instances to an active revision (@etianen).
* Removed ``Version.object_id_int`` field, in favor of a unified ``Version.object_id`` field for all primary key types (@etianen).

* **Breaking:** ``reversion.get_for_object_reference()`` has been moved to ``Version.objects.get_for_object_reference()`` (@etianen).

* **Breaking:** ``reversion.get_for_object()`` has been moved to ``Version.objects.get_for_object()`` (@etianen).

* **Breaking:** ``reversion.get_deleted()`` has been moved to ``Version.objects.get_deleted()`` (@etianen).

* **Breaking:** ``Version.object_version`` has been renamed to ``Version._object_version`` (@etianen).

* **Breaking:** Refactored multi-db support (@etianen).

    django-reversion now supports restoring model instances to their original database automatically. Several parameter names have also be updated to match Django coding conventions.

    If you made use of the previous multi-db functionality, check the latest docs for details. Otherwise, everything should *just work*.

* **Breaking:** Removed ``get_ignore_duplicates`` and ``set_ignore_duplicates`` (@etianen).

    ``ignore_duplicates`` is now set in reversion.register() on a per-model basis.

* **Breaking:** Removed ``get_for_date()`` function (@etianen).

    Use ``get_for_object().filter(revision__date_created__lte=date)`` instead.

* **Breaking:** Removed ``get_unique_for_object()`` function (@etianen).

    Use ``get_for_object().get_unique()`` instead.

* **Breaking:** Removed ``signal`` and ``eager_signals`` argument from ``reversion.register()`` (@etianen).

    To create revisions on signals other than ``post_save`` and ``m2m_changed``, call ``reversion.add_to_revision()`` in a signal handler for the appropriate signal.

    .. code:: python

        from django.dispatch import receiver
        import reversion
        from your_app import your_custom_signal

        @reciever(your_custom_signal)
        def your_custom_signal_handler(instance, **kwargs):
            if reversion.is_active():
                reversion.add_to_revision(instance)

    This approach will work for both eager and non-eager signals.

* **Breaking:** Removed ``adapter_cls`` argument from ``reversion.register()`` (@etianen).

* **Breaking:** Removed ``reversion.save_revision()`` (@etianen).

    Use reversion.add_to_revision() instead.

    .. code:: python

        import reversion

        with reversion.create_revision():
            reversion.add_to_revision(your_obj)


Signals
^^^^^^^

* **Breaking:** Removed ``pre_revision_commit`` signal (@etianen).

    Use the Django standard ``pre_save`` signal for ``Revision`` instead.

* **Breaking:** Removed ``post_revision_commit`` signal (@etianen).

    Use the Django standard ``post_save`` signal for ``Revision`` instead.


Helpers
^^^^^^^

* **Breaking:** Removed ``patch_admin`` function (@etianen).

    Use ``VersionAdmin`` as a mixin to 3rd party ModelAdmins instead.

    .. code::

        @admin.register(SomeModel)
        class YourModelAdmin(VersionAdmin, SomeModelAdmin):

            pass

* **Breaking:** Removed ``generate_diffs`` function (@etianen).

    django-reversion no supports an official diff helper. There are much better ways of achieving this now, such as `django-reversion-compare <https://github.com/jedie/django-reversion-compare>`_.

    The old implementation is available for reference from the `previous release <https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion/blob/release-1.10.2/src/reversion/helpers.py>`_.

Models
^^^^^^

    .. code:: python

        # Old-style import for accessing the admin class.
        import reversion

        # Access admin class from the reversion namespace.

            pass

    In order to support Django 1.9, the admin class has been moved to the following
    import:

    .. code:: python

        # New-style import for accesssing admin class.
        from reversion.admin import VersionAdmin

        # Use the admin class directly.
        class YourModelAdmin(VersionAdmin):

* **Breaking:** Updated the location of low-level API methods.
    Prior to this change, you could access the low-level API using the following import:

    .. code:: python

        # Old-style import for accessing the low-level API.
        import reversion

        # Use low-level API methods from the reversion namespace.
        @reversion.register
        class YourModel(models.Model):

            pass

    In order to support Django 1.9, the low-level API
    methods have been moved to the following import:

    .. code:: python

        # New-style import for accesssing the low-level API.
        from reversion import revisions as reversion

        # Use low-level API methods from the revisions namespace.
        @reversion.register
        class YourModel(models.Model):

            pass

* **Breaking:** Updated the location of http://django-reversion.readthedocs.org/en/latest/signals.html.

    .. code:: python

        # Old-style import for accessing the reversion signals
        import reversion

        # Use signals from the reversion namespace.
        reversion.post_revision_commit.connect(...)

    In order to support Django 1.9, the reversion signals have been moved to the following
    import:

    .. code:: python

        # New-style import for accesssing the reversion signals.
        from reversion.signals import pre_revision_commit, post_revision_commit

        # Use reversion signals directly.
